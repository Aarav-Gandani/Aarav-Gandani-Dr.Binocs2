        <h1> My favourite cartoon character is Dr. Binocs</h1>
        <p> My favourite cartoon character is Dr. Binocs as his videos give information about plants, inventionsand more! In some of his videos, he answers the questions how, , why, what if etc. I like him as I get information so I know the world better.He also gives awreness about things like pollution, viruses etc. Seeing this show can give me information so I can perform better in the long run. </p>
